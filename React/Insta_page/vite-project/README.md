# React Login/Sign Up Page

This project is a simple React application that provides a login and sign-up page. Users can switch between the login and sign-up forms using a toggle button. The project uses React's state management to handle the switching between these two forms and displays different fields accordingly.


## Usage

Users can perform the following actions:

* Toggle between Login and Sign-Up: Click on the "Log in" or "Sign up" text to switch between the login and sign-up forms.
* Input Fields: Fill out the required fields for either the login or sign-up form.
* Submit Button: Click the "Log in" or "Sign up" button to submit the form. Note that this is a simple interface, and no backend functionality is implemented.


## Project Structure
* App.js: The main React component that renders the login/sign-up page.
* App.css: Stylesheet for the application.
* README.md: This readme file.
* package.json: Configuration file for project dependencies.
* node_modules: Directory containing project dependencies (created after running npm install).
## Acknowledgements
