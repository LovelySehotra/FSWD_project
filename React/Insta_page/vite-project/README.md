Project Title: React Login/Sign Up Page
Project Description
This project is a simple React application that provides a login and sign-up page. Users can switch between the login and sign-up forms using a toggle button. The project uses React's state management to handle the switching between these two forms and displays different fields accordingly.



Usage
This React application provides a simple login and sign-up interface. Users can perform the following actions:

Toggle between Login and Sign-Up: Click on the "Log in" or "Sign up" text to switch between the login and sign-up forms.
Input Fields: Fill out the required fields for either the login or sign-up form.
Submit Button: Click the "Log in" or "Sign up" button to submit the form. Note that this is a simple interface, and no backend functionality is implemented.
